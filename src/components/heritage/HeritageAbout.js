        A quaint hill town, perched against the backdrop of Doddabetta (2,637
        m), the highest peak in the Nilgiris, Ootacamund, in Tamil Nadu, is
        lined with traditional and colonial-style buildings, which make it the
        perfect fusion of the new and the old. Clear blue skies, lush green
        hills, deep verdant valleys and pleasant weather culminate to make this
        gem of the Nilgiris (Blue Mountains) one of the most attractive tourist
        destinations in South India. Peppered with coffee and tea plantations,
        forests of eucalyptus, conifers and pines, and a thick cover of shola
        trees, Ootacamund is the perfect getaway for nature lovers.
